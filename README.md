Professor Meadows 

Assignment 2 

## Intro

This website is in its initial stages. I eventually want this to be a sweet and simple website for new farmers that need help. Right now, I just have 2 pages with extraordinarily little information and a few interactions. I want this site to help new farmers understand climate and how it affects their crops. I will show them what crops need to be planted during certain times for optimized growth and success.   

## Page Descriptions

Like I said before, my site is at a super early stage. The first page is just a welcoming page where you can see an important message and navigate to my second page. The second page has a table with only 2 (so far) different crops and what season they should be planted. (I will go deeper into this in the future) 

## Future Enhancements

In the future, I would like to add more visuals that welcome the user. I will also make my site super user-friendly and provide valuable information to farmers about crops and climate. Another thing I would like to add is images of the different crops. 

## Sources

I used Professor Meadow's recordings and YouTube video to guide me through this assignment so far. It was super helpful. I also used w3 school and bootstrap for cosmetics and headings. I wanted to see how good AI is, so I asked ChatGPT to “make me a table with 2 rows using HTML” and it worked!  

## Competitive Analysis

- [Climate Smart Farming](http://climatesmartfarming.org/): This site has a nice user-friendly interface that welcomes the users to learn about resilience and sustainability as a farmer. What I really like about this site is how simple it is. There are a few buttons you can click to answer any question you have. While inspecting the site's code, I noticed they used something called “Schema.org” and I am not too sure what it is. However, it looks like they used it for a header. Some things I would like to implement into my own site from this one are pictures of animals and useful climate data. 

- [Farmers.gov - Conservation: Climate Smart](https://www.farmers.gov/conservation/climate-smart): This site looks a little more jumbled to me and not as user-friendly as the first one I looked at. However, it does have some things that I like about it. I like how they have an additional resources tab that leads you to other content. The other content I am referring to provides simple and informative tips. Inspecting the website's code, I noticed that they use Google Tag Manager. I have never heard of this before and wonder what it is. Some things I would like to implement into my own website from this one are the simple facts that they have written in parts of their main page. 

- [WSU Weather](https://weather.wsu.edu/): This site is not necessarily a site for “farmers”, but I chose to add it because it has something really interesting that I might be able to add to my own. At the top of the page, they have a map of their state and what the climate is like in specific parts of it. I'm sure this would be really challenging to do, but it is a cool idea. Inspecting the site's code, I noticed that they do not have many lines of code. It looks like they use bootstrap. 

## GitHub Repository Research

- **ProjectDrawdown/Spatial-aez**: This repository gave me insight into using climate data via maps. I believe this will be something I possibly implement into my sight in the future. Their data comes from ((http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/download.php))  

- **Protontypes/Open-Sustainable-Technology**: This repository and README were filled with a ton of information that will be useful to me. This showed me how informative a readme can be. It uses a bunch of hyperlinks and headings to make it user-friendly. 

## Reflection 

Although I do not know what I am doing 100 percent, it does not seem too hard to navigate through everything with the help of my professor and using online resources like [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). I struggled a little with the Java portion and making the button. I ended up figuring it out. I am excited to learn more and move forward in the future.
